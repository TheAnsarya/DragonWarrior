I've been working with emulation and ROM hacking since the mid-late '90s.

My name is <code>Andy Hubbard</code>, but currently, I mostly go by <code>Wayness</code> or <code>Ansarya</code>.

If you need to contact me, look me up as <code>Wayness</code> on the the RHDN or TCRF discord servers.

I primarily work on these games:

* Dragon Warrior/Dragon Quest:
** NES:
*** [[Dragon Warrior|Dragon Warrior (NES)]]
*** [[Dragon Warrior II (NES)]]
*** [[Dragon Warrior III (NES)]]
*** [[Dragon Warrior IV (NES)]]
** SNES:
*** [[Dragon Quest I & II (SNES)]]
*** [[Dragon Quest III (SNES)]]
* Final Fantasy:
** SNES:
*** [[Final Fantasy: Mystic Quest|Final Fantasy: Mystic Quest (SNES)]]

My dream that I have been slowly working on for 25 years is porting DW4 (NES) to DQ3r (SNES). I have done a lot of work on this and am currently aiming for a DW4 Chapter One demo release in mid 2025.
